### Learning Objectives
    - How to define a Class
    - How to add methods to a class
    - Why and how to add a static method to a class
    - How to extend a class from another
    - Metaprogramming and symbols

### Task Requirements
#### Task 0
```
Implement a class named ClassRoom:

Prototype: export default class ClassRoom
It should accept one attribute named maxStudentsSize (Number) and assigned to _maxStudentsSize
```

#### Task 1
```
Import the ClassRoom class from 0-classroom.js.

Implement a function named initializeRooms. It should return an array of 3 ClassRoom objects with the sizes 19, 20, and 34 (in this order).
```

#### Task 2
```

Implement a class named HolbertonCourse:

Constructor attributes:
name (String)
length (Number)
students (array of Strings)
Make sure to verify the type of attributes during object creation
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
```

#### Task 3
```
Implement a class named Currency:

- Constructor attributes:
code (String)
name (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
Implement a method named displayFullCurrency that will return the attributes in the following format name (code).
```

#### Task 4
```
Import the class Currency from 3-currency.js

Implement a class named Pricing:

Constructor attributes:
amount (Number)
currency (Currency)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.
Implement a method named displayFullPrice that returns the attributes in the following format amount currency_name (currency_code).
Implement a static method named convertPrice. It should accept two arguments: amount (Number), conversionRate (Number). The function should return the amount multiplied by the conversion rate.
```

#### Task 5
```

Implement a class named Building:

Constructor attributes:
sqft (Number)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter for each attribute.
Consider this class as an abstract class. And make sure that any class that extends from it should implement a method named evacuationWarningMessage.
If a class that extends from it does not have a evacuationWarningMessage method, throw an error with the message Class extending Building must override evacuationWarningMessage
```

#### Task 6
```
Import Building from 5-building.js.

Implement a class named SkyHighBuilding that extends from Building:

Constructor attributes:
sqft (Number) (must be assigned to the parent class Building)
floors (Number)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter for each attribute.
Override the method named evacuationWarningMessage and return the following string Evacuate slowly the NUMBER_OF_FLOORS floors.
```

#### Task 7
```
Implement a class named Airport:

Constructor attributes:
name (String)
code (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
The default string description of the class should return the airport code (example below).
```

#### Task 8
```
Implement a class named HolbertonClass:

Constructor attributes:
size (Number)
location (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
When the class is cast into a Number, it should return the size.
When the class is cast into a String, it should return the location.
```

#### Task 9
Fix given code to make it work

#### Task 10
```
Implement a class named Car:

Constructor attributes:
brand (String)
motor (String)
color (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Add a method named cloneCar. This method should return a new object of the class.
Hint: Symbols in ES6
